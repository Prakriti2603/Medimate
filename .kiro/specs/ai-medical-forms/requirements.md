3. WHEN training is complete THEN new models SHALL be deployed with A/B testing
4. WHEN user corrections are made THEN they SHALL be incorporated into training data
5. WHEN model performance degrades THEN alerts SHALL be generated for retraining

### Requirement 4: Medical Terminology Recognition

**User Story:** As an AI system, I want to understand medical terminology, abbreviations, and context to accurately extract and categorize medical information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN processing medical text THEN the AI SHALL recognize standard medical terminology
2. WHEN abbreviations are encountered THEN they SHALL be expanded to full terms
3. WHEN medical codes are found THEN they SHALL be validated against standard code sets (ICD-10, CPT)
4. WHEN context is ambiguous THEN the AI SHALL use surrounding text for disambiguation
5. WHEN new terminology is encountered THEN it SHALL be flagged for vocabulary updates

### Requirement 5: Multi-Format Document Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to process various document formats including PDFs, images, handwritten notes, and digital forms.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN PDF documents are uploaded THEN text and structured data SHALL be extracted
2. WHEN image documents are processed THEN OCR SHALL convert images to searchable text
3. WHEN handwritten documents are scanned THEN handwriting recognition SHALL extract text
4. WHEN structured forms are uploaded THEN field-level data SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN document quality is poor THEN preprocessing SHALL enhance readability

### Requirement 6: Real-Time Processing Pipeline

**User Story:** As a user, I want document processing and form filling to happen in real-time with progress tracking and immediate results.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN processing SHALL begin immediately
2. WHEN processing is in progress THEN users SHALL see real-time progress updates
3. WHEN extraction is complete THEN results SHALL be displayed within 30 seconds
4. WHEN large documents are processed THEN they SHALL be handled efficiently without timeout
5. WHEN multiple documents are uploaded THEN they SHALL be processed in parallel

### Requirement 7: Quality Assurance and Validation

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want AI-extracted data to be validated against medical standards and flagged for potential errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN data is extracted THEN it SHALL be validated against medical reference databases
2. WHEN inconsistencies are detected THEN they SHALL be highlighted for review
3. WHEN critical information is missing THEN alerts SHALL be generated
4. WHEN data quality is assessed THEN quality scores SHALL be provided
5. WHEN validation fails THEN specific error messages SHALL guide corrections

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Workflows

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI form filling to integrate seamlessly with existing MediMate workflows without disrupting current processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN AI processing is complete THEN data SHALL integrate with existing claim workflows
2. WHEN forms are auto-filled THEN they SHALL maintain compatibility with current validation rules
3. WHEN AI suggestions are made THEN users SHALL retain full control over final submissions
4. WHEN integration occurs THEN existing user permissions and security SHALL be maintained
5. WHEN workflows are updated THEN AI integration SHALL adapt automatically

### Requirement 9: Performance Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to monitor AI performance, track accuracy metrics, and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN AI processes documents THEN performance metrics SHALL be collected and stored
2. WHEN accuracy is measured THEN it SHALL be tracked over time with trend analysis
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be categorized and analyzed for patterns
4. WHEN improvements are made THEN before/after comparisons SHALL be available
5. WHEN reports are generated THEN they SHALL include actionable insights for optimization

### Requirement 10: Privacy and Security Compliance
